					<a href="https://cdqwertz.itch.io/miflected">Miflected</a><br><br>
					Miflected is a puzzle game about mirrors made for the mirror game jam.<br><br>
					<strong>Note:</strong> Since this game was quite well received, I will
					probably remake this game in my game engine and improve the graphics,
					gameplay and polish it.

					<a href="https://cdqwertz.itch.io/wydroion">Wydroion</a><br><br>
					Wydroion is a fast-paced action game made for the GMTK game jam.<br><br>
					<strong>Note:</strong> This game's tutorial in really bad and the
					game is therefore pretty hard to get into, but it is actually quite
					fun once you get into it. (I will probably have to improve this game
					at some point in time)
